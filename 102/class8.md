### Class 8 Notes - Operators & Loops

Comparison operators 

- A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

- Equal (==) returns true if the operands are equal.


Assignment operators

- An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

- equal (=) assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand

- That is, `x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.


while statement

- This is a fun one to code because it will not let the user continue unless they put the correct input.
