### Class 2 Notes - The Coder's Computer

**Text Editors**

Text editors are the most basic programs to type code. Text editors are already installed on your computer, but really are not ideal for coding. There's no corrections, suggestions, or helpful information within them. That's why most (if not all) people use code editors.

**Code Editors**

Code editors are interactive programs that make coding simple and easy to understand. By combining prompts, color coding, and explanation comments, coding is easier than ever. They also work with many coding languages so you don't need to download tons of applications to experiment with other languages.

Here are some of the most popular examples:

- VSCode
- GitHub's Atom
- NotePad++

**The Terminal** aka command line interface (CLI)

This is a way to navigate your computer through text-based commands (vs using a mouse and keyboard). You are given a prompt and type a respone. The terminal will produce a text response, and the cycle continues.

**Here are some navigation shortcuts to know:**

- pwd -> Print Working Directory -> this shows your current or present working directory
- ls - > list -> this can show your current directory or specific directories
- cd -> Change Directories -> this allows you to change directories

**Key takeaways from this lesson:**

1. Everything is a file
2. Files can have any extension or none at all
3. Everything is case sensitive
