## Class 1 Notes - Markdown

Markdown is important to know and understand when learning to code.
It's even more basic than HTML and can be learned very quickly.

Here are some quick examples to see the differences between Markdown and HTML:

    Markdown                HTML
    # Heading level 1       <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    **I am bold**           <strong>I am bold</strong>
    *I am italicized*       <em>I am italicized</em>
