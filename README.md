## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset allows you to change and adapt to *any* situation. When encountering obstacles, if you have a growth mindset, you will be better prepared to tackle problem instead of giving up. 

**Some reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**
- You don't have to do it alone, there are endless resources
- You don't have to learn it all once, practice and skill take time
- Making it fun will help you enjoy the process of learning


For example, learning how to bake bread might seem daunting. However, there are so many resources out there for beginners. Your first loaf might be a disaster (mine was) but if you take some time to learn more about the process, you will be better prepared the next time. Also, for me it's important to have fun. I like to listen to some music or a podcast while I knead the bread, which can sometimes feel like forever. With practice, I hope to someday bake a beautiful loaf like these below.
