# My Reading Notes for CodeFellows

Hi, my name is Melanie. I'm new to programming but enjoy learning languages and building things.

## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset allows a person to change and adapt to difficult situations. When encountering obstacles, if you have a growth mindset, you will be better prepared to tackle problem instead of giving up. 

**3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**
1. You don't have to do it alone, there are endless resources
2. You don't have to learn it all once, practice and skill take time
3. Make it fun! Enjoying the process will help you be successful

For example, learning how to bake bread might seem daunting. However, there are so many resources out there for beginners. Your first loaf might be a disaster (mine was) but if you take some time to learn more about the process, you might be better prepared the next time. Finally, I think it's important to have fun! Listen to some music or a podcast while you knead the bread, which sometimes feels like forever.
