### Component-Based Architecture

- What is a “component”? 
  - A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
- What are the characteristics of a component?
  - Reusability
  - Replaceable
  - Not context specific
  - Extensible
  - Encapsulated
  - Independent
- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
  - Ease of deployment
  - Reduced cost
  - Ease of development
  - Reusable
  - Modification of technical complexity
  - Reliability
  - System maintenance and evolution
  - Indepenent

### What is Props and How to Use it in React

- What is “props” short for?
  - Props stands for properties
- How are props used in React?
  - Props are being used for passing data from one component to another
- What is the flow of props?
  - Props are being passed in a uni-directional flow (one way from parent to child)


#### Things I want to know more about

Can props be used to to affect mulitple components at once?
