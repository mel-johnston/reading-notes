## Class 7 Notes - REST

### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
    - Roy Fielding is one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    - Because they weren't designed to be used like that. They were designed to be used by a small group of people, on a small group of machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    - HTTP is the protocol that Fielding and his friends created to enable computers to talk to each other.
4. What does a GET do?
    - GET is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
5. What does a POST do?
    - POST is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.
6. What does PUT do?
    - PUT is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource.
7. What does PATCH do?
    - PATCH is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
