## Class 14 Notes - Diversity, Equity, Inclusion in Tech

### Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? Computers in homes were marketed to men
Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? They knew how to use a computer and women didn't

When are diversity efforts most successful? Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.
Why do diverse companies perform better? Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones.
Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
