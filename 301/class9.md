## Class 9 Notes - Functional Programming

### [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. What is functional programming?
    - Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
    - It does not cause any observable side effects.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    - The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
4. What is immutability?
    - Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
5. What is Referential transparency?
    - If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

1. What is a module?
    - A module is a piece of code that is used in another piece of code. It is a way to break down a large program into smaller parts.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
    - The require() function is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. It is used to load modules dynamically at runtime.
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
    - We use the require() function to bring another module into the file we are working in.
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
    - We have to export the module.
