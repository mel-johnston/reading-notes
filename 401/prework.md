## Prework - SQL

Structured Query Language is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. SQL databases are very simple and therefore provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

- Most of this was review since we had this assignment in previous readings. One useful thing though was when there is a file with a space in the title. To move or delete that file, you add quotes around it.

## Growth Mindset

I have become more aware of the impact my words and actions have on those around me, and am working on expressing myself in a more empathetic and understanding manner. I've also noticed that I'm better able to manage my own emotions and stress levels when I take the time to practice self-care and engage in activities that bring me joy. Through recent interactions with others, I am learning the value of active listening and how it can improve my relationships and ability to connect with those around me.

## Biases

I've noticed certain unconscious biases I have and the impact they can have on my thoughts and actions towards others. I'm making an effort to challenge these biases by seeking out diverse perspectives and actively listening to those with different backgrounds and experiences. I'm working on being more mindful of the language I use and the assumptions I make about others, and am working to replace these with a more open-minded and non-judgmental approach.
