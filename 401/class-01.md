## Class 01 Notes - Node Ecosystem

### Node.js

- How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
  - Node is like a helper for computers. When you build a website or a game, there's a part of it that runs on your computer and a part that runs on a big computer somewhere else. Node helps the big computer understand what the website or game needs and do what it's supposed to do, like remember your high score or show you a picture. It helps the big computer work faster and do things in a smart way, so you can have a better experience using the website or playing the game.
- What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
  - A runtime is the environment in which a programming language like JavaScript is executed, or run. JavaScript is typically used for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces for websites, but with Node.js, it can also be used for building server-side applications.
- What is Node used for?
  - Node.js is used for building server-side applications, like web servers, real-time applications, APIs, back-end services, and command-line tools.

#### Additional

I'm looking forward to getting back to React.

For this class, my goals are to work on application development in the Node ecosystem.
