## Class 12 Notes - JS Canvas & Chart

### Canvas

What does the `canvas` allow a developer to acheive?

- `canvas` allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript

What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

- Any content bewteen the opening and closing tags is fallback content and will display if the `canvas` element isn't supported by the browser.

Explain what the `getContext()` method does.

- The `getContext()` takes one argument which is the type of context.  For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.

### Chart.js

What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

- Chart.js provides a set of commonly used chart types, plug-ins, and customization options. 
- It has built it chart types and also community created chart types

List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.

- Bar chart - showing data values represented as veritcal bars
- Doughnut and Pie Charts - showing relational proportions between data
- Line chart - plotting data points on a line

What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

- Visually, charts are more eye catching, but more importantly, easier to understand and process data.

How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?

- If you used a table to display data, you could easily incorporate Chart.js to re-display that data.
