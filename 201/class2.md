## Class 2 Notes - Intro to HTML & CSS


### HTML

- Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML? Using semantic tags saves you time from having to style every single element on your page. It helps keep things organized and consistent. 
- How many levels of headings are there in HTML? There are six heading levels. However it's recommended to only use three per page. 
- What are some uses for the `sup` and `sub` elements? These are often used when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and math equations. 
- When using the `abbr` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term? Provide a full expansion of the term in plain text, along with the `abbr` to mark up the abbreviation. 
    We use `abbr`HTML`abbr`, Hypertext Markup Language, to structure our web documents.



### CSS

- What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML? You can apply CSS to HTML inline, internal stylesheet, or external stylesheet. 
- Why should we avoid using inline styles? Inline styling can become cumbersome and confusing. It is recommended to avoid this. 

- Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
  - What is representing the selector? h2
  - Which components are the CSS declarations? {everything inside these}
  - Which components are considered properties? color, padding

### JS

- What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks? A string
- List 4 types of JavaScript operators. Addition (+), Assignment (let Variable), Strict Equality (===), Does-not-equal (!==)
- Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function. Mathmatical equation



- An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.
- What is the use of an else if? This is used to chain extra choices/options.
- List 3 different types of comparison operators. Greater than (>), less than (<), and does-not-equal (!==)
- What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`? 
  - `&&` - AND; allows to you chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
  - `||` â€” OR; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
