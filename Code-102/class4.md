## Class 4 Notes - Structure Web Pages

### Wireframe & Design

A wireframe is much like the outline that is made for an essay or report.
It allows you to plan out your vision for a web page so you have something to reference, and collaborate on when working with others or clients.
There are many different options when it comes to building your wireframe.
You could draw it with pencil and paper or use one of the many wireframe tools available online.
